## Name of Project: Gender in academia

In this training project I learned how to utilize D3, DC and Crossfire to create a spreadsheet of graphs that relate to salaries and participation in academia broken down by gender. This project was an exercise based on data visualisation. It was a video tutored project I found this a great stepping stone in the use of data in my web development practise. At this point I was learning Javascript Libraries trying to branch to back end web development.
